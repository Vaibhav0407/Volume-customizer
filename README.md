Volume Control Using Hand Gestures 🎛️🖐️
This project allows users to control system volume using hand gestures detected via a webcam. It uses OpenCV for real-time video processing and MediaPipe for accurate hand tracking. The system adjusts the volume based on the distance between the thumb and index finger, providing a touch-free interaction experience.

✅ Real-time Hand Tracking – Detects hand gestures using MediaPipe
✅ Smooth Volume Adjustment – Controls system volume dynamically
✅ Efficient & Lightweight – Uses OpenCV for optimized video processing
✅ Cross-Platform Support – Works on Windows & Linux

🔧 Technologies Used
🔹 Python | OpenCV | MediaPipe | Pycaw
